Couples' Behaviors Study - Get Paid to Participate in a Grad Student Study!
Dive into our exciting study to uncover how couples coordinate their division of house chores, the emotions involved in this process, and how it shapes individual and relationship well-being! 

Each person will receive $50 and will be entered in a raffle to win $200!

To join, you and your partner should be cohabitating, have been in a relationship for at least six months, both be willing to participate, and be 18 years or older. Our study is split into two phases: first, an intake phase where you'll fill out questionnaires and engage in a Zoom conversation task; second, a mobile phase where you'll respond to brief (~3 minutes) surveys every morning and evening for two weeks.
